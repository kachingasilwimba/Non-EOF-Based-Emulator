# Non-Empirical Orthogonal Function Climate Land Model Emulation

This repository contains code and data for a non-empirical orthogonal function climate land model emulation project. The goal of this project is to develop a more efficient and accurate model for predicting climate patterns using non-empirical orthogonal function techniques.
